# Brainfuck

## What's this?

A program to execute [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code.

Invented by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993, Brainfuck is an [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) programming language: a humorously inconvenient language, consisting of just eight single-character commands, that is nevertheless [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), and hence theoretically capable of performing any computation that can be done by a more conventional programming language.

## Context

The core of this program is an exercise from my early days at 01Founders, included here for fun, along with some extra error handling, tests, and a timeout option.

# Usage

Assuming you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed, clone this repo and navigate into it, then enter `go run . "Insert Brainfuck instructions here!"` in your terminal to build and run the program. Optionally follow this with a positive number, representing a timeout in seconds: `go run . "Insert Brainfuck instructions here!" 10`.

Alternatively, compile the source code once and for all with `go build`, then run the resulting executable file with `./brainfuck "Insert Brainfuck instructions here!"` on macOS or Linux, or `brainfuck.exe "Insert Brainfuck instructions here!"` on Windows.

To run all tests, `go test ./...`.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Language_design) for a guide to the eight commands of the Brainfuck instruction set.

## Example programs

```
Hello World!
"++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++."

AAA
"+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++>+++[<.>-]"

ABC
"+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++>+++[<.+>-]"

A
"+>++++++++[<++++++++>-]<."
```

In the above example, the 2nd register acts as a counter, allowing us to run the loop 8 times. Inside the loop, we increment the 1st register by 8. When the counter reaches 0, the loop ends and we move the back to the print the value in the first register. ASCII 'A' is 1 + 8 \* 8 = 65. Notice that 8 + 8 = 16. If we want to express 64 as a different product, we'd have to double the number of pluses in one place for every halving in the other: 16 + 4 = 20, 32 + 2 = 34. In general, the closer we can get both factors to the square root of the target quantity the better. (For rectangles of a given area, the square is the rectangle with the smallest perimeter.)

```
AAA
"+>++++++++[<++++++++>-]+++[<.>-]"

ABC
">++++++++[<++++++++>-]+++[<+.>-]"

123456789
">+++++++[<+++++++>-]+++++++++[<.+>-]"

0123456789
">+++++++<->[<+++++++>-]++++++++++[<.+>-]"

I LOVE YOU
"++++++++[>+++++++++>++++++++>++++<<<-]>+.>>.<<+++.+++.+++++++.>+++++.>.<<+++.----------.++++++."
